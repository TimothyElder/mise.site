>For the professional, one's meez is an obsession, one's sword and shield, the only thing standing between you and chaos. If you have your meez right, it means you have your head together, you are "set up", stocked, organized, ready with everything you need and are likely to need for the tasks at hand.

— Anthony Bourdain, *Le Halles Cookbook*

The ambition for [Mise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place) is to make it an open source qualitative data analysis tool that social scientists can use as an alternative to some of the more bloated and expensive proprietary software out there. It is meant to preserve some of the functionality that can be found in software like atlas.ti or Dedoose while having no cost and a more straightforward design.
